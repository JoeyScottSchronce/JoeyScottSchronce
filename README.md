# Welcome to my profile!

I’m a dedicated and detail-oriented software developer with a strong foundation in web development. I routinely solve LeetCode and write testcases with Golang. I have a solid understanding of Test-Driven and Behavior-Driven Development, along with the DevOps, Agile, and Scrum methodologies.

In the early stages of my software development training, I've built scalable backend applications, prototyping with Python using the Flask and Django frameworks. I've built frontend apps using React. I've also created and managed CI/CD pipelines using Tekton, learned to use git for version control, created CRUD APIs with MongoDB, and deployed containerized applications to IBM Cloud Container Registry, using tools like Docker, Kubernetes, and OpenShift.

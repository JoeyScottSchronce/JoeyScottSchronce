        <p>I'm interested in developing a strong foundation in Web Development & Data Analytics. But, I also like learning about
            Programming too. I'm excited to embark on a fulfilling journey where I can continuously learn and grow while making
            meaningful contributions. I'm currently learning all the basics. I've explored a few of the GitHub reposatory courses as well and
            I've enjoyed them. Honestly, I don't know what projects I'm looking forward to collaborating on yet but I will know when I find
            them. I look forward to meeting new people, learning new things, and towards the long journey ahead in these exciting fields. </p><br>

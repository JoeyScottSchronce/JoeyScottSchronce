# Hi there, I'm Joe

I'm interested in continuing to develop a stronger foundation in Software Engineering. I currently have experience in creating Applications using Vite & React, Python apps with Flask, CRUD apps with MongoDB, and Node with Express. I've also learned how to create unit tests in Python with unittests, and JavaScript with Jasmine, for test-driven and behavior-driven development. I'm familiar with containerization using Docker, Kubernetes, & OpenShift, as well as building CI/CD pipelines. I also have an understanding of Agile & how to practice DevOps. I would like to gain more hand-on experience by contributing to GitHub and by finding an entry-level programming position. I would also like to meeting more people with similar interests and abilities to learn and grow with.

# Hi there, I'm Joe

I'm interested in developing a strong foundation in Web Development, Data Analytics, and Software Engineering. I'm excited to embark on a fulfilling journey where I can continuously learn and grow while making meaningful contributions. I've explored a few of the GitHub reposatory courses as well and I've enjoyed them. Honestly, I don't know what projects I'm looking forward to collaborating on yet but I will know when I find them. I look forward to meeting new people, learning new things, and towards the long journey ahead in these exciting fields.
